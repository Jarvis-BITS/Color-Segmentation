# Color-Segmentation
##### Python program uses Scikit Machine learning K-Clusters model to classify every color into one of the 5 nearest color cluster, then OpenCV is used to output segmented image made only from the top 5 prominent colors alongwith a barchart and piechart displaying % of the top 5 prominent colors in the picture.

###### Note:You can try this out with any image by changing the image source in the start of the code. The number of prominent colors can also be changed by changing the no. of clusters from 5 to a desired number of your choice :smile:
